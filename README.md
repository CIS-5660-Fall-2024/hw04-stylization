# Take Me Out! - Unity Stylization Exploration

## Project Overview:
This is an exploration into stylized shading using Unity's ShaderGraph. For my project, I chose the "Dadaist" animation style scattered with elements of collage and pop from Scottish band Franz Ferdinand's hit music video and song "Take Me Out". Below is how it turned out in the end (obvious sound credit to Franz Ferdinand)!

To interact with the scene, press "Space" to swap materials, "P" to distort geometry, and "F" to do both, taking you out!

### Overall details:
- Voronoi dithering
- Noise-affected thresholds for shading
- Screenspace textures blended with toon shading
- Custom rendered background using noise-masks and polar nodes
- Distorted outlines
- Stop-motion animated textures using UV-offsets and time-stepped functions
- Custom vignette filter node
- Noise-based grain/artifacts effect
- Camera jitter script
- Interactive material swapping
