# HW 4: *3D Stylization*

## Project Overview:
In this assignment, you will use a 2D concept art piece as inspiration to create a 3D Stylized scene in Unity. This will give you the opportunity to explore stylized graphics techniques alongside non-photo-realistic (NPR) real-time rendering workflows in Unity.

# Tasks

## 0. Base Project Overview

After forking the repo, take a moment to watch this brief HW/Base Project Overview which goes over things that you're expected to bring over from the lab, and etc.
- [See the Project Overview here](https://youtu.be/JmVTmpgSz5U)

## 1. Picking a Piece of Concept Art
The concept art I am inspiring my scene off of is a piece of visual development done by Chris Sanders when developing the Disney film Lilo and Stitch. I really enjoy the water color aspects of it!

## 2. Interesting Shaders

Creating two custom shaders to emulate the watercolor-like texture and feel of the concept art, my first shader utlizied my three tone shader and added noise to it, as well as watercolor textures, then adding Fresnel noise to add a rim around it to look like paint fading at the edges. I then also created a second shader for the background that utilized Voronoi noise and a custom MapCircle function to create a paper-like surface. I wanted it to be similar to the first shader, in that it looks watercolor-like, but also have its own look and act more of a background.

## 3. Outlines
As show in the image above in #2, I used normal and depth buffers, as well as Render Features to create a black outline that gives an inked look. I think it works especially well for my project given the concept art!

---
## 4. Full Screen Post Process Effect 
I also added a second overlay full screen vignette effect. I was particularly inspired by older films and television shows where the color and saturation of what is happening on screen fades as it goes to the edges. I also wanted the perspective of the viewer to be looking down directly at a piece of paper as they were working, so it made sense.

## 5. Create a Scene
Using Unity's controls, create a ***SUPER BASIC*** scene with a few elements to show off your unique rendering stylization. Be sure to apply the materials you've created. Please don't go crazy with the geometry -- then you'll have github problems if your files are too large. [See here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github). 

Note that your modelling will NOT be graded at all for this assignment. It is **NOT** expected that your scene will be a one-to-one faithful replica of your concept art. You are **STRONGLY ENCOURAGED** to find free assets online, even if they don't strongly resemble the geometry/objects present in your concept art. (TLDR; If you choose to model your own geometry for this project, be aware of the time-constraint and risk!)

Some example resources for finding 3D assets to populate your scene With:
1. [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/)
2. [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)
3. [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/)

## 6. Interactivity
As a finishing touch, let's show off the fact that our scene is rendered in real-time! Please add an element of interactivity to your scene. Change some major visual aspect of your scene on a keypress. The triggered change could be
* Party mode (things speed up, different colorization)
* Memory mode (different post-processing effects to color you scene differently)
* Fanart mode (different surface shaders, as if done by a different artist)
* Whatever else you can think of! Combine these ideas, or come up with something new. Just note, your interactive change should be at least as complex as implementing a new type of post processing effect or surface shader. We'll be disappointed if its just a parameter change. There should be significant visual change.

### To-Do:
* Create at least one new material to be swapped in using a key press
* Create and attach a new C# script that listens for a key press and swaps out the material on that key press. 
Your C# script should look something like this:
```
public Material[] materials;
private MeshRenderer meshRenderer;
int index;

void Start () {
          meshRenderer = GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
}

void Update () {
          if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)){
                 index = (index + 1) % materials.Count;
                 SwapToNextMaterial(index);
          }
}

void SwapToNextMaterial (int index) {
          meshRenderer.material = materials[index % materials.Count];
}
```
* Attach the c# script as a component to the object(s) that you want to change on keypress
* Assign all the relevant materials to the Materials list field so you object knows what to swap between.

## 7. Extra Credit
Explore! What else can you do to polish your scene?
  
- Implement Texture Support for your Toon Surface Shader with Appealing Procedural Coloring.
    - I.e. The procedural coloring needs to be more than just multiplying by 0.6 or 1.5 to decrease/increase the value. Consider more deeply the relationship between things such as value and saturation in artist-crafted color palettes? 
- Add an interesting terrain with grass and/or other interesting features
- Implement a Custom Skybox alongside a day-night cycle lighting script that changes the main directional light's colors and direction over time.
- Add water puddles with screenspace reflections!
- Any other similar level of extra spice to your scene : ) (Evaluated on a case-by-case basis by TAs/Rachel/Adam)
